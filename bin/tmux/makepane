# Make tmux re-run the last command that was run in $MAKEPANE

tmux send-keys -t ${MAKEPANE} C-p Enter

# Maybe in future, if ${MAKECMD} is set, run that command instead.

# The reason I don't just do run-shell -t ${MAKEPANE} is that I don't get the
# history and any scrollback through previous results.
# Problems : if you split any panes before $MAKEPANE, you end up changing the
# index of the pane and thus you have to update MAKEPANE. It would be nice if
# the pane could have some kind of reference besides the SESSION:WINDOW.PANE
# notation?

# Or perhaps if only MAKEPANE has a certain environment variable set, we could
# search for that pane and choose it as the target for our command execution.
