# Vertically tile two separate tmux windows into a single two-paned window.

# No assumptions are made about the behaviour when either original window
# already contains splits. This is just a convenience method to suit my
# workflow in Vim where I sometimes want full screen Vim, sometimes a full
# screen shell, and sometimes both paned, with a single keypress.
